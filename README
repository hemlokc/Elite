I found the original pytxtelite at
http://automaticromantic.com/static/misc/pytxtelite.txt .
pytxtelite is a conversion of Ian Bell's txtelite.c 1.2 (and parts of 1.4)
to python (2.5, maybe earlier).

As I was interested in planet names only, I removed everything
else. This script contains the minimum for generating planet
names.

It also has a simple command-line interface for printing planet names (n)
and for jumping to the next galaxy (j).

I made a simple wrapper script too called elite.py. If you want to get
the name of a random planet, use elite.py.
